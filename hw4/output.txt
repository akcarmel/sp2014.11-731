 the european monetary union was severely undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .

 defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will bring financial chain reaction of the pentagon corridors to the fields of battle in afghanistan on the line and to civil assembly . 
 " the implications of these reductions would be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to the senators республиканцу республиканке john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham , south carolina . 
 " so , will make such a strong reduction , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or the building -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote the senators . 
 " these changes would undermine confidence in those who support our army , and will bring serious damage combat readiness . " 
 " although the foreign military financing in the emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets , " panetta warned . 
 " staff will be reduced , that will lead to the опозданиям staffer with military suppliers , and the legal and political support will be disturbed . " 
 " the consequences of sequestration in the department of defense will be a rapid decline in the united states as the world 's leading military power . "

 whether a letter to panetta or the latest warning senators will lead to budget compromise or strengthen calls for the release of the pentagon from reductions , will see later .

 " this is a paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks in the pentagon . 
 and panetta said that some of the biggest defense project may encounter obstacles , including those that passed the tests , and some only on the early stages of planning .

 a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life . 
 administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys .

 stories of fraud on the exams in school and college - it 's the usual thing . 
 mentors who should teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable . 
 studies have shown that within a single day , you can lie from 10 up to 200 times . 
 another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other . 
 in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where the need to exclaim " caught ! " , identifying lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the last six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on the psychology and physiology . 
 should not be from this it is difficult to draw the conclusion that the liars notice and it is hard to expose . 
 i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which it is easy to learn how to identify lies - and which helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviews , negotiating or management . 
 we know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lies , that they say , more often than not наглая ) . 
 watch asphyxia , laughter , voice characteristics of your object . 
 rats can fix the upper part of his body , when they try to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , to change its position in a certain way or demonstrate the " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us . 
 привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have a sexual relationship with this woman ... miss lewinsky " or to repeat a complicated question entirely . 
 someone might use the " qualification language " when responding to a complex question : " well ... to tell the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know . " 
 there is no magical means deception detection , to detect the lies , but to master the skill you can .

 why do you constantly change the words in the yellow ledbetter at concerts ? 
 he sings it , and i think , he uses the first thing that comes to him in the head . 
 they are so many that i can talk all day about басистах , which i love . 
 i think we all feel some гранж alienated from the rest of the word . 
 at first , your music was more grim , and now it has become more positive . 
 it 's interesting , because , i think , there are a few songs on this album , which may seem easier , but there are songs such as the end or just breathe , which are considered to be very grim , though they may sound a bit positive . 
 i think that when you grow , and in your life has been some sort of injury and you have lost family member or friend , these events are starting to affect your creativity and your music , and those two songs , of course , reflect this for me .

 architects agree with the possibility of the contest after wrangling about contributions 
 in the middle of the '80s , now on the rise угасшей metropolitan corporation barcelona ( skb ) , this administration for the promotional leaflets кольсеролы . 
 moreover , it is accompanied by comparing the new york in the pictures with the central park . 
 it was so , until , in september , the council announced a huge event , consisting of 16 contests for the gates in many other кольсеролу . 
 or so , or if someone wants to put the gates on the field . 
 competition , and their organizational side , and their impact on the city , barcelona are the topic for discussion all architects . 
 and this fact leads to precisely one of the few coincidences between what they say barcelona 's three architect and the scientists who attended . 
 for рольдана , after reaching the shoreline is becoming a " necessary " to discuss " the front side of the mountain " , when a proposal ильдефона серды with green apple , the mountain , was not done . 
 модоло as рольдан and байона with experience in the city building , called the proposal as " intellectual challenge " with " some of the dangers " . 
 the first fear is the limitation of the border , where you can build . 
 " we need to think about new urban planning , because current instruments [ with regard to the general of the capital plan ( gsp ) ] can lead to real trouble . " 
 модоло recalls that already has a work made outside the кальсеролы , which " should not miss ailianduo " , although he 's grateful for the possibility that city hall offers his profession , to join in this project " since the beginning . " 
 байона hints that answer the question , which specifies the name of this part of the complex , as the rules of competition lacks a common type of кольсеролы : " it was announced 16 intersecting contests , " he says , " within the meaning of the sea - mountain views , but there is no buckling reading , to see and understand the region as a whole . " 
 on the other hand , the project for some , the gate could overlap on the programme and identifying with the project architect for the neighboring gate .

 social protection is to find the gene study of obesity in children and young people ; it is supported by experts from restarts 
 in a statement , head of medical research in the area of biochemistry specialty hospital national medical center of the 21st century miguel cruz lopez explained that was collected from the multidisciplinary team of physicians , nurses , dieticians and social workers . 
 in the study population ( anything or not ) invited to participate , in sports centers mssi , participating in the study , in the valley of mexico city , where every saturday from 8:00 a.m. , will be carried out tests with the participation of the children .

 he explained that on saturday will be held антропометрические measuring all participants ( height , weight and waist girth ) , measuring blood pressure and glucose levels , fat , cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis of the ( in order to identify genes that are linked to childhood obesity ) . 
 in medical research , conducted in the period from 1999 to 2006 , says that just 6 years there has been a growth : in the case of boys 77 percent were obese , in the case of girls 47 % ; when it comes to weight , as well as experienced significant growth , " said specialist mssi . 
 he reported that on average in the mexican is 65 percent of the offspring of american indians , the 30 % of europeans and the five percent of africans and this condition affected genes , which are linked to diabetes and overweight .

 рафаель эррера , a researcher at the department of chemical , unam , has developed a polymer - bitumen modified to produce a mixture of the best quality , sustainable to the impact of environmental and temperature . 
 in his lecture in technological view of the pits , as part of the international year of chemistry , said that laboratory , for which he is responsible for developing polymer - modified bitumen mixed with characteristics close to the bitumen production , but with the best opposition both at high , and at low temperatures . 
 he explained that the bitumen , the most difficult part of the oil is a sequence of molecules of hydrocarbons , some high - molecular mass , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his tmina вязкоупругое behavior . 
 this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changes throughout the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , said an expert in the area of chemical engineering . 
 among the most is the upper layers of bitumen , made up of small stones , опущенных in bitumen and then спрессованных . 
 a movement of the vehicles and latch effort , it helps to be distributed on the road to cover very well . 
 on the асфальтовом cover , he added , put the last layer , called a layer of wear and tear , which is made out of the small stone , in fact sand also immersed in the asphalt . 
 as part of the pavement , which will receive and distribute these efforts , a layer of wear and tear also requires the proper thickness , and you need to take into account the material , from which he is . 
 when the earth crude , water seeps into the body coverage and it 's hard for her to go from there , it causes размягчение all strata of the cover , and therefore education yam . 
 as well as a member of the national transportation system , researchers explained that load is another important factor in the formation of holes , and therefore the thickness of each layer coating should always be connected to transport load and it is necessary to ensure this requirement , to prevent the frequent appearance of yam . 
 what lacked candidate from the valle , in order to become a new miss colombia ? 
 on this time мелина ramirez serna was supposed to be contented with what was on the podium winners with a silver crown and ribbon proclaiming her new princess in colombia .

 there is also a suggestion that valle sinned defects on the buttocks and фиброзом spokeswoman , who was seen on her stomach , but it is debatable , as the jury specifically noted her as кандидатку with " natural beauty " , given its more than a healthy body , good nutrition and physical work . 
 the magazine , journalist _guido ойос кромос believes that the mistake females valle de cauca was that she has undergone major surgery . 
 her body has never been her advantage , and here she was punished for it . 
 so it or not , the fact is that today we have мелины begins a year of the board , not as queen , but as a princess , position , which allows her to represent colombia on one of the international competitions , the organizers of the national contest .

 and 66 % believe that legalization of euthanasia will not be a signal that the life of the elderly or disabled persons it has less value . 
 as regards the extension or termination of the medical care for patients , the situation is less , they say the authors of the report . 
 the committee of experts also requires that health professionals were trained in the spirit of respect for the avoidance of medical care at the end of his life without fear and criminal prosecution . 
 finally , in particular with regard to palliative or terminal sedation , already widely in the canadian healthcare institutions , the committee requires that she was then , when it is not for blunting the physical pain , not as euthanasia , and has been the same constraints . 
 some experts in the area of legislation , associated with the health care , have already expressed concerns regarding conclusion of the report to the experts of the royal society of canada .

 if there is a topic , the decision on which cannot be taken after a very short discussion or under the influence of emotions , so this is an energy policy . 
 this is a healthy trend that the electoral meeting place , and become an occasion for reflection about the share of their nuclear energy . 
 france needs to build their opinion on objective facts and data on the rational . 
 during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources , to continue electricity production all the time , not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalance - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate . 
 that is why germany there is one in his or her decision to abandon nuclear energy . 
 on the other hand , the great britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil - so that 's just a few of those who strongly to their projects . 
 although the model of germany , which is based on the renewable energy , sometimes as an example , the reality belies this argument . 
 european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 % of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого due ; the wind which carbon emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe . 
 as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french companies are benefiting from cheap electricity in europe . 
 the price that the majority of the french refuse to pay more because they do not oppose in principle , this type of energy . 
 heavily export - oriented , she draws an entire contemporaries specialized on international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and creates a lot of jobs that may not be moved to another industry . 
 some engineer and electrician will be the order epr , calculated to work 60 years old , if the planned closure of its manufacturer ? 
 areva solutions with a low carbon development , nuclear and renewable energy sources , testifies to the взаимодополнимости . 
 security in france we have a body , which carries out , too , and transparent control existing energy centres , such as фламанвиль . 
 for 50 years , the nuclear industry has survived three serious incident . 
 in the chernobyl reactor device and unforgivable human error led to tragedy .

 both sides see immigration as a burden for the french economy , and for french society . 
 francois hollande , in his program was confined to platitudes , saying that " joint work will help solve our immigration problem " . 
 as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , publisher at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants . 
 fears for the influence of immigrants are based on the view , that they are able to replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking decrease in salaries . 
 unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor force , and the most qualified in the dynamic sectors , where training is not connected to the proposals work . 
 just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a lack of анестезиологов , complementarity , existing between local that the arrival of the immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect the wages of local workers . 
 and it is without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates -- large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all immigrants are based ) . 
 according to the organization of labor , for example , in germany , an immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring to the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in an average of 150,000 euros . 
 these teeth , which used to scare immigrants , was given exactly the opposite effect . 
 democracy is a valuable acquisition ; but at the same time and fragile . 
 some thought that democracy has triumphed over its enemies , it is enough to arrange a vote and make it so direct , as far as possible . 
 universal vote , even though and is a sine qua non condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of suppression " , as once - republican philosopher etienne said вашро . 
 the european crisis , which we are experiencing , is an economic crisis , but in the first place is a political crisis and the crisis of democracy . 
 we 'll win nothing , demanding a series of national referendums , organized by as the need and in хаотическом order . 
 there is no , we are dreaming not on the edge the guillotine , but on the implementation of - the joint , clear and uninterrupted - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level . 
 the entire europe is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from their own weakness and lack of solidarity . 
 many worry about the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but the entire europe was gradually losing its sovereignty , and each of its nations together with her . 
 because only a collaborative effort of the europeans will be able to reduce the severity of debt of each , free markets and prepare for the future , investing in him . 
 after a long discussion on this supply and jacques delors , the socialist now require all european economic government . 
 but to represent it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in life граздан , is another madness and a new impasse . 
 to establish a republic in france , it was necessary to " create a " of republicans . 
 this can only be done through the creation of a more democratic europe on the political level , real people 's european sovereignty .

 among the wreckage and the remaining after the surgery , french and нигерские investigators found a few phone sim cards belonging to the terrorists . 
 analysis of the incidents calls pointed out several interlocutors , 58/89 in mali , niger and nigeria . 
 " this is a step forward , but there is no doubt that we need to wait for more reliable evidence , before the talk about operational cooperation between aqmi and boko haram . " 
 " for many years already , we know that the sect идейную and receives financial support from the outside and that it is becoming more and more intense , " says кунле амуво , a nigeria researcher . 
 the international community , led by the washington now has put pressure on абуджу , to pay attention to the boko haram , which creates problems . 
 it focused mainly on the churches , bars and authorities . 
 in the past christmas day she took responsibility for the diluted earnings per share as a result of which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then again for one in abuja . 
 in august , the local branch of the united nations , will be their first international goal . 
 today , when the aqmi has spiked in mali and niger , and the somalis from al-shabaab operate in kenya , boko haram represents a new threat to continent . 
 can weakened crisis america to take the lead of a complex world with the help of the simple , and the rather simplistic ideas ? 
 kane has a few days , mitt romney , the distance , rick perry and other множат loud , but deprived of the details of the statements on foreign policy , which are traditionally a strong republican party . 
 mitt romney , who has the best chance for the nomination from the " good old party , " has threatened to take on the chinese complaint to the wto and accuse them of " manipulating its currency is a sensitive topic for america , irritated migration as much as its industries in asia . 
 john huntsman , former obama ambassador to china and the only one candidate , the complex foreign policy , was unable to overcome position that indulging your emotions . 
 but huntsman , who is held at the bottom of the ratings , remained неуслышанным . 
 romney has also promised the military strikes against iran if sanctions will not be able to halt its nuclear program . 
 " if obama will be re - elected , they will have a bomb . " 
 entrepreneur херман kane , the second in the ranking candidates demonstrated the daunting ignorance of the cases . 
 the texas governor rick perry , who supports israel and to the military strikes on iran , says that he was ready to use the us army against drug cartels in mexico . 
 all this is a far cry from the republican candidate john mccain 's 2008 , тяжеловеса foreign policy .

 these two countries will lose part of his authority : they will become more difficult to influence on russia , by threatening to shut down access to western european markets .

 " in case of an accident we close the flow of gas for less than a minute , " said jens muller . 
 but this seems unlikely that piping designers stitches , calculated on протечку only once in 100 000 years old . 
 сигароообразный the handset is inside the a 1 - metre diameter pipeline and pushed forward the flow of gas . 
 gas pipeline was designed to work in 50 years ago without the need for the slightest maintenance and repairs . 
 these five companies created a joint venture , called the northern flow , which has been commissioned to build and operate gas pipeline . 
 then gazprom gave the company in the lease on the 20 years with the possibility of extension of the entire amount of gas transportation . 
 funding for natural gas pipeline was provided on 30 % of the shareholders , and the 70 % of bank credit . 
 out of the baltic sea gas pipeline in lubmin on a sandy beach , mulberry coniferous trees .

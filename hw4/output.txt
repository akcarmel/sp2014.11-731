 at a hearing in the city council last month , the schools chancellor dennis m. уолкотт , said that the layoffs were part of the budget , which they have signed in june . 
 representatives of the district council 37 , said that they have with the notice claims , the department of education , warning that filed a lawsuit against him ; on wednesday will be held a press conference to announce a formal file a lawsuit in state supreme court in manhattan .

 the budget control act , which took place in august , demanded , and the house of representatives , and the senate voted for the amendment of the balanced budget .

 this is a very sensitive topic for commanders , who do not want to look ungrateful or objecting to the society , which they serve . 
 as a result , most conversations about the pity is going on quietly and just between the two of combat veterans . 
 some people will look at them with admiration , because they smash the rebels and there were in the exotic locations .

 around 30 survivors and relatives of victims of the attended the hearing .

 " asia can be up to some extent is protected by , but she ca n't be invulnerable . " 
 european monetary union has been badly undercut by the european debt crisis , in the last few months . 
 unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he can lead the global economy into recession again , and has led to calls for the leading emerging economies to gather together to help the eurozone to find a solution . 
 anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything that can , " to help the eurozone , such as its own economy is now declining exports and decline in foreign capital inflows . 
 " we have a grandiose objectives , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "

 defense secretary leon panetta tempers on monday in congress , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will cause financial chain reaction from the pentagon corridors to the fields battlefield in afghanistan on the line and the civil assembly . 
 " the implications of these reductions would be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to the senators республиканцу республиканке john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham , south carolina . 
 " so , will make such a strong reduction , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or the building -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote the senators . 
 " these changes will undermine the trust of those who support our own army and will do severe damage to the combat readiness . " 
 " although the military financing in the foreign emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , military achievements be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta . 
 " the staff personnel will be reduced , that will lead to опозданиям with payments military suppliers , and the legal and political support will be disrupted . " 
 " the consequence of sequestration in the department of defense will be the fastest decline of the united states as the world 's leading military powers . " 
 " this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . " 
 whether panetta a letter or the recent warnings senators will lead to the pentagon 's budget compromise or inflame calls for release from cutbacks , will see later . 
 at a press conference last week 's defence minister painted a gloomy picture of what may be followed by further -- troops from the shell , but without the core . 
 " it 's a paper tiger , the army with the barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers , who can accomplish the mission , " panetta said in their introductory remarks in the pentagon . 
 and panetta said that some of the biggest defense project may encounter obstacles , including those that passed the tests , and some only on the early stages of planning . 
 halt to further develop and test f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say , that is a vital next step , in order to improve and to counter potential threats , china and other opponents . 
 a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life . 
 administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys . 
 former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial machinations during the campaign , associated with укрывательством extramarital affairs . 
 history about the fraud charges on the exams in school and college - it 's the usual thing . 
 mentors , who should be to teach the opposite , they send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable . 
 studies have shown that within a single day , you can lie from 10 up to 200 times . 
 another study has shown that unfamiliar people солгали three times in the first 10 minutes and get acquainted with each other . 
 in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where the need to exclaim " caught ! " , identifying lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the last six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on the psychology and physiology . 
 should not be from this it is difficult to draw the conclusion that the liars notice and it is hard to expose . 
 i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which it is easy to learn how to identify lies - and which helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviews , negotiating or management . 
 we know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lies , that they say , more often than not наглая ) . 
 watch asphyxia , laughter , voice characteristics of your object . 
 rats can capture the upper part of his body , when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , to change its position in a certain way or to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- is this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us . 
 привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have a sexual relationship with this woman ... miss lewinsky " or to repeat a complicated question entirely . 
 someone might use the " qualification language " when responding to a complex question : " well ... to tell the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know . " 
 there is no magical means deception detection , to detect the lies , but to master the skill you can .

 at first , your music was more grim , and she now has become a little more positive . 
 it 's interesting , because , i think , there are a few songs on this album , which may seem easier , but there are songs such as the end or just breathe , which are considered to be very grim , though they may sound a bit positive .

 модоло as рольдан and байона with experience in the city building , called the proposal as " intellectual challenge " with " some of the dangers " . 
 first fear is this is the limitation of the borders , where it is possible to build . 
 " we need to think about new urban planning , because current instruments [ with regard to the general of the capital plan ( gsp ) ] can lead to real trouble . " 
 модоло recalls that there are already work made outside the кальсеролы , which " should not miss deaf ears , " even though he 's grateful for the possibility that city hall offers his profession , to join in this project " from the beginning . " 
 байона hints that answer the question , which asks the name of this part , complex , as in the rules of the contest lacks a common type of кольсеролы : " it was announced 16 intersecting contests , " he says , " within the meaning of the sea - mountains , but there are no longitudinal reading , to see and understand the area as a whole .

 in his lecture in technological view of the pits , as part of the international year of chemistry , reported that laboratory , for which he is responsible , is developing polymer - modified bitumen for mixed with characteristics of the close to the bitumen production , but with the best opposition , both in high and low temperatures . 
 he explained that the bitumen , the most difficult part of the oil is a sequence of molecules of hydrocarbons , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight - so - called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his typical вязкоупругое demeanor . 
 this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changes throughout the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , said an expert in the area of chemical engineering . 
 among the most is the upper layers of bitumen , made up of small stones , опущенных in bitumen and then спрессованных . 
 a movement of the vehicles and latch effort , this helps the forces very well be on the road to cover . 
 on the асфальтовом cover , he added , put the last layer , called a layer of wear and tear , which is made out of the small stone , in fact sand also immersed in the asphalt . 
 as part of the pavement , which will receive and distribute these efforts , a layer of wear and tear also requires the proper thickness , and you need to take into account the material , from which he is . 
 when the earth crude , water seeps into the body coverage and it 's hard for her to go from there , it causes размягчение all strata of the cover , and therefore education yam . 
 as well as a member of the national system , researchers explained that transport load - it is another important factor in the formation of holes , and therefore the thickness of each layer cover should always be connected to transport load and need to ensure this requirement , to prevent the frequent appearance of yam .

 between the magazine , a journalist _guido ойос кромос believes that the mistake females valle de cauca was that she has undergone major surgery . 
 her body has never been its advantage , and here she was punished for doing so . 
 so it or not , the fact is that today we have мелины begins a year of the board , not as queen , but as a princess , position , which allows her to represent colombia on one of the international competitions , the organizers of the national contest .

 and 66 % believe that legalization of euthanasia will not be a signal that the life of the elderly or disabled persons it has less value . 
 as regards the extension or termination of the medical care for patients , the situation is less , they say the authors of the report . 
 the committee of experts also requires that health professionals were trained in the spirit of respect for the avoidance of medical care at the end of his life without fear and criminal prosecution . 
 finally , in particular with regard to palliative or terminal sedation , already widely in the canadian healthcare institutions , the committee requires that she was then , when it is not for blunting the physical pain , not as euthanasia , and has been the same constraints . 
 some experts in the area of legislation , associated with the health care , have already expressed concerns regarding conclusion of the report to the experts of the royal society of canada .

 germany , in turn , documented the growth of 0.5 % for the same period . 
 if there is a topic , the decision on which cannot be taken after a very short discussion or under the influence of emotions , so this is an energy policy . 
 this is a healthy trend that the election meeting place , and become an occasion for reflections on the share of their nuclear energy . 
 france needs to build their opinion on objective facts and data on the rational . 
 during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources , to continue electricity production all the time , not forgetting about the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalances - theme , which has disappeared from the environmental debate . 
 that is why germany there is one in his or her decision to abandon nuclear energy . 
 on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil - here is the only a few of those who strongly continues to their projects . 
 although the model of germany , which is based on the renewable energy , sometimes as an example , the reality belies this argument . 
 european champion construction of turbines , from which it receives 30 % of its electricity , and she was also the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого wind ; because of what carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe . 
 as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french companies are benefiting from cheap electricity in europe . 
 the price for the majority of french refuse to pay all the more , because they do not oppose in principle , this type of energy . 
 heavily export - oriented , she draws an entire contemporaries specialized on international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and creates a lot of jobs that may not be moved to another industry . 
 what an engineer - electrician will become the order epr , calculated to work sixty years , if the planned closure of his producer ? 
 areva solutions with a low carbon development , nuclear and renewable energy sources , testifies to the взаимодополнимости . 
 security in france we have a body , which carries out , too , and transparent control existing energy centres , such as фламанвиль . 
 for 50 years , the nuclear industry has survived three serious incident . 
 device in the chernobyl reactor , and unforgivable human error led to a tragedy . 
 the nuclear industry will extract the lessons from this accident , as learned from the two of previous ones . 
 as it is seen all specialists in the field of energy , to build a reactor , halt its construction in фламанвиле will be a great gift to competitors areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь toward the conquest of leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy . 
 then were administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news release , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from france on may 23 ) said that " do not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . " 
 both sides see immigration as a burden for the french economy , and for french society . 
 in his program of francois hollande was confined to platitudes , saying that " a joint work will solve our immigration problem " . 
 as remind us economists ian goldin and jeffrey cameron in a recent book , обобщившей past data on immigration ( special people : how migration shaped our world and will determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants . 
 fears for the influence of immigrants are based on the view , that they are able to replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking decrease in salaries . 
 unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor force , and the most qualified in the dynamic sectors , where training is not connected to the proposals work . 
 just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a lack of анестезиологов , complementarity , existing between local that the arrival of the immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect the wages of local workers . 
 and it is without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates -- large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all immigrants are based ) . 
 according to the organization of labor , for example , in germany , an immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring to the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in an average of 150,000 euros . 
 mentioned teeth , which was used only to scare immigrants , have given exactly the opposite effect . 
 democracy is the most valuable acquisition ; but it at the same time , and fragile . 
 some thought that democracy has triumphed over its enemies , it is enough to arrange a vote and make it so direct , as far as possible . 
 universal vote , even though and is a sine qua non condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of suppression " , as once - republican philosopher etienne said вашро . 
 the european crisis , which we are experiencing , is an economic crisis , but in the first place is a political crisis and the crisis of democracy . 
 we 'll win nothing , demanding a series of national referendums , organized by as the need and in хаотическом order . 
 there is no , we are dreaming not on the edge the guillotine , but on the implementation of - the joint , clear and uninterrupted - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level . 
 the entire europe is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from their own weakness and lack of solidarity . 
 many worry about the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but the entire europe was gradually losing its sovereignty , and each of its nations together with her . 
 because only a collaborative effort of the europeans will be able to reduce the severity of debt of each , free markets and prepare for the future , investing in him . 
 after a long discussion of this proposal the socialists and jacques delors all now require , a european economic government . 
 but to represent it without more strong economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in the life граздан , is another madness and a new dead end . 
 to establish a republic in france , it was necessary to " create a " of republicans . 
 this can only be done through the creation of a more democratic europe on the political level , real people 's european sovereignty . 
 in fact , 2011 will be completed 11 % rise in the world sales of microprocessors ( bank cards , mobile phones with sim cards ) , above , according to the eurosmart , 6 thousand million units . 
 in this year around the world will be sold to 460 million бесконтактных chip - card against 320 million a year ago ! 
 europe , for a long time lagged from the asia - pacific region , is now moving forward in the field of бесконтактных payments .

 but this is only the first stage of development in the future means of payment , then there is a mobile phone . 
 " we look forward to the world 's sale from 80 to 120 million units in 2012 , " explains mark бертен , the head of the eurosmart . 
 yesterday , the crédit agricole announced experiment , from december through june of next year , in the massacre . 
 confirmed for a long time предполагавшиеся connection between the terrorist group al qaeda in islamic maghreb ( aqmi ) and the nigerian sect boko haram . 
 " the way in which use these two organizations , and reports to the secret services show that they were actively cooperating , " he explained , without going into the details . 
 among the debris , the remaining after the operation , french and нигерские investigators found a few phone sim - cards belonging to the terrorists . 
 analysis of the incidents calls pointed out several interlocutors , 58/89 in mali , niger and nigeria . 
 " this is a step forward , but there is no doubt , we need to wait for more reliable evidence , before talk about the operational cooperation between aqmi and boko haram . " 
 " for many years , it is known that sect receives financial and идейную support from the outside and that it is becoming more and more and more active , " says кунле амуво , nigerian researcher . 
 the international community , headed by the washington now puts pressure on абуджу , they pay attention to the problems that creates the boko haram . 
 she aims mainly on the the church , bars and law enforcement authorities . 
 in the past christmas day she took responsibility for the diluted earnings per share as a result of which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then again for one in abuja . 
 in august , the local office of the united nations will be their first international goal . 
 today , when the aqmi has spiked in mali and niger , and the somalis from al-shabaab operate in kenya , boko haram represents a new threat to continent . 
 can weakened crisis america to take the lead of a complex world with the help of the simple , and the rather simplistic ideas ? 
 already a few days of mitt romney , the distance kane , rick perry and other multiply loud , but deprived of the details of the statements on foreign policy , which are traditionally strong republican party . 
 mitt romney , who has the best chance for the nomination from the " good old party , " has threatened to take on the chinese complaint to the wto and accuse them of " manipulating its currency is a sensitive topic for america , irritated migration as much as its industries in asia . 
 john huntsman , former obama ambassador to china and the only one candidate , the complex foreign policy , was unable to overcome position that indulging your emotions . 
 but huntsman , who rests at the bottom of the ratings , has remained in неуслышанным . 
 romney has also promised to military strikes on iran , if sanctions wo n't be able to halt its nuclear program . 
 " if obama will be re - elected , they will have a bomb . " 
 entrepreneur distance kane , the second in the rating candidates demonstrated the daunting ignorance of the affairs . 
 the texas governor rick perry , who supports israel and is committed to the military strikes on iran , says that he was ready to use us army in mexico against the drug cartels . 
 all this is a far cry from the republican candidate john mccain 's 2008 , тяжеловеса foreign policy . 
 they remind us that obama was himself a lover and that he had to lower the tone in the respect of the fight against terror . 
 after iraq , it does not believe in a military interventions , which confused in the sand . 
 northern stream , the new gate to log on to of russian gas to europe . 
 he is calculated at the supplies of gas the equivalent of 30 million households . 
 more than 500 guests , including four heads of state and governments took part in the last tuesday on the shores of the baltic sea , between orchestra and exquisite performance snacks , in the opening of the nord stream , a new gas pipeline , which directly connects russia and germany under the water . 
 on a new pipeline 27.5 thousand million additional cubic metres of gas will come every year in western europe for the first 1 224 km long pipeline connecting the leningrad region , with the earth of mecklenburg - pomerania . 
 and the ability to build of the third pipeline on the same direction have already been discussed . 
 these two countries will lose part of his authority : they will become more difficult to influence on russia , by threatening to shut down access to western european markets . 
 but the price of europe 's energy , because the project has created the gap between the eastern and western europe . 
 " this pipeline is a part of the cooperation with russia , a new artery that connects us organically , " said francois fillon , opening the gas pipeline , showing the extent to which the large natural gas contracts are important politically and economically . 
 " one hundred of them was necessary to remove or destroy them as a precaution , " said jens muller , a spokeswoman for the company 's northern flow . 
 the pipeline is a long metal serpent weight , equal weight of the 242 эйфелевых towers , without gaps across its length , without the and without service stations . 
 " in the event of an accident , we close the flow of gas less , than a minute , " said jens muller . 
 but this seems unlikely that piping designers stitches , calculated on протечку only once in 100 000 years old . 
 сигароообразный the handset is inside the a 1 - metre diameter pipeline and pushed forward the flow of gas . 
 gas pipeline was designed to work in 50 years ago without the need for the slightest maintenance and repairs . 
 these five companies have created a joint venture , called the northern flow of , which has been instructed to build and operate gas pipeline . 
 then gazprom gave the company in the lease on the 20 years with the possibility of extension of the entire amount of gas transportation . 
 funding for natural gas pipeline was provided on 30 % of the shareholders , and the 70 % of bank credit . 
 out of the baltic sea gas pipeline in lubmin on a sandy beach , mulberry coniferous trees . 
 sensors measure the pressure , temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before they siphoned it in the german gas pipelines . 
 on the full capacity it will be 3 million per hour , and in the 6 million by 2012 .

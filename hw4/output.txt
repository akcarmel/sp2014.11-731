 " although the foreign military financing in the emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets , " panetta warned . 
 " the staff personnel will be reduced , that will lead to опозданиям with payments military suppliers , and the legal and political support will be disrupted . "

 a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and the повсеместны deceit and lies in their everyday lives . 
 administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys . 
 former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial machinations , during the campaign , connected with the укрывательством extramarital affairs . 
 history about the fraud charges on the exams in school and college - it 's the usual thing . 
 mentors , who should be to teach the opposite , they send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable . 
 in a single day , studies have shown that , and you can lie from the 10 up to 200 times . 
 another study has shown that unfamiliar people солгали three times in the first 10 minutes and get acquainted with each other . 
 in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where the need to exclaim " caught ! " , identifying lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the last six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on the psychology and physiology . 
 should not be from this it is difficult to draw the conclusion that the liars notice and it is hard to expose . 
 i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which it is easy to learn how to identify lies - and which helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviews , negotiating or management . 
 we know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lies , that they say , more often than not наглая ) . 
 watch позой , a laugh , voice characteristics of your object . 
 rats can fix the upper part of his body , when they try to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , to change its position in a certain way or demonstrate the " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us . 
 привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have a sexual relationship with this woman ... miss lewinsky " or to repeat a complicated question entirely . 
 someone can use the " qualification language " , when answering a difficult question : " well ... to tell the truth ... as far as i know . . . as far as i know . " 
 there is no magical means , to expose the lies , but to master the skill to detect deception can be .

 рафаель эррера , a researcher at the department of chemical , unam , has developed a polymer - modified bitumen , to produce a mix of the best quality , sustainable to the impact of the environment and temperature . 
 in his lecture in technological view of the pits , as part of the international year of chemistry , reported that laboratory , for which he is responsible , is developing polymer - modified bitumen for mixed with characteristics of the close to the bitumen production , but with the best opposition , both in high and low temperatures . 
 he explained that the bitumen , the most difficult part of the oil is a sequence of molecules of hydrocarbons , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight - so - called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his typical вязкоупругое demeanor . 
 this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changes throughout the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , said an expert in the area of chemical engineering . 
 among the most is the upper layers of bitumen , made up of small stones , опущенных , in the bitumen , and then спрессованных . 
 a movement of vehicles and latch efforts , it helps forces to be distributed on the road to cover very well . 
 on the асфальтовом cover , he added , put the last layer , called a layer of wear and tear , which is made out of the small stone , in fact sand also immersed in the asphalt . 
 as part of the pavement , which will receive and distribute these efforts , a layer of wear and tear also requires the proper thickness , and you need to take into account the material , from which he is . 
 when the earth crude , water seeps into the body coverage and it 's hard for her to go from there , it causes размягчение all strata of the cover , and therefore education yam . 
 as well as a member of the national transportation system , researchers explained that load is another important factor in the formation of holes , and therefore the thickness of each layer coating should always be connected to transport load and it is necessary to ensure this requirement , to prevent the frequent appearance of yam . 
 why not have enough candidate from the valle in order to become a a new miss colombia ? 
 on this time мелина ramirez serna was supposed to be contented with what was on the podium winners with a silver crown and ribbon proclaiming her new princess in colombia .

 where the highest rate in the country are in quebec , 86 % of the deaths occur in the hospital . 
 now , according to experts , who also studied the position of all the countries where such actions were legalized or декриминализованы , there is no evidence that decriminalisation of abuse in the application , i.e. the implementation of euthanasia or suicide with outside help in relation to the people who cannot or do not want to take such a decision . 
 and 66 % believe that legalization of euthanasia will not be a signal that the life of the elderly or disabled persons it has less value . 
 as regards the extension or termination of the medical care for patients , the situation is less , they say the authors of the report . 
 the committee of experts also requires that health professionals were trained in the spirit of respect for the avoidance of medical care at the end of his life without fear and criminal prosecution . 
 finally , in particular with regard to palliative or terminal sedation , already widely in the canadian healthcare institutions , the committee requires that she was then , when it is not for blunting the physical pain , not as euthanasia , and has been the same constraints .

 spain has proved to be under the shelling in the markets before the parliamentary elections in on sunday . 
 insee , in spite of that , in the side of reducing the numbers in the second quarter , with the fall of 0.1 % in gross domestic product ( gdp ) instead of stagnation . 
 germany , has in turn , documented the growth of 0.5 % year - over - the same period . 
 if there is a topic , the decision on which cannot be taken after a very short discussion or under the influence of emotions , so this is an energy policy . 
 this is a healthy trend that the electoral meeting place , and become an occasion for reflection about the share of their nuclear energy . 
 france needs to build their own opinion on objective data facts and , on the rational . 
 during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources , to continue electricity production all the time , not forgetting about the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalances - theme , which has disappeared from the environmental debate . 
 that is the reason why germany is one in his or her decision to abandon the nuclear energy . 
 on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil - here is the only a few of those who strongly continues to their projects . 
 although the model of germany , which is based on the renewable energy , sometimes as an example , the reality belies this argument . 
 european champion construction of turbines , from which she gets 30 % of its electricity , and she was also the biggest consumer of coal and gas прерывистого due ; the wind which carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 % respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe . 
 as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french companies are benefiting from cheap electricity in europe . 
 the price for the majority of french refuse to pay all the more , because they do not oppose in principle , this type of energy . 
 heavily export - oriented , she draws an entire contemporaries specialized on international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and creates a lot of jobs that may not be moved to another industry . 
 what an engineer - electrician will become the order epr , calculated to work sixty years , if the planned closure of his producer ? 
 areva solutions with a low carbon development , nuclear and renewable energy sources , testifies to the взаимодополнимости . 
 in france we have the security body , which carries out , too , and a transparent control existing energy centres , such as фламанвиль . 
 for 50 years , the nuclear power industry has survived three serious an incident . 
 in chernobyl reactor , unit , and unforgivable human mistake has led to tragedy . 
 the nuclear industry will extract the lessons from this accident , as learned from the two of previous ones . 
 as it is seen all the specialists in the field of energy , willing to build the reactor , halt its construction in фламанвиле will be a great gift rivals areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь toward the conquest of leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy . 
 then were administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news release , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from france on may 23 ) said that " do not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . " 
 on both sides see immigration as a burden for the french economy , and for french of society . 
 in his program of francois hollande was confined to platitudes , saying that " a joint work will solve our immigration problem " . 
 as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , publisher at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants . 
 fears for the influence of immigrants are based on the view , that they are able to replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking decrease in salaries . 
 unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor force , and the most qualified in the dynamic sectors , where training is not connected to the proposals work . 
 just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a lack of анестезиологов , complementarity , existing between local that the arrival of the immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect the wages of local workers . 
 and it 's without taking into account the fact that the diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - were all immigrants are based ) . 
 according to the organization of labor , for example , in germany , an immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring to the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in an average of 150,000 euros . 
 mentioned teeth , which was used only to scare immigrants , have given exactly the opposite effect . 
 democracy is a valuable acquisition ; but also ; and fragile . 
 some thought that democracy has triumphed over its enemies , it is enough to arrange a vote and make it so direct , as far as possible . 
 universal vote , even though and is a sine qua non condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of suppression " , as once - republican philosopher etienne said вашро . 
 the european crisis , which we are experiencing , is an economic crisis , but in the first place is a political crisis and the crisis of democracy . 
 we 'll win nothing , demanding a series of national referendums , organized by as the need and in хаотическом order . 
 there is no , we are dreaming not on the edge the guillotine , but on the implementation of - the joint , clear and uninterrupted - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level . 
 the entire europe is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from their own weakness and lack of solidarity . 
 many worry about the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but the entire europe was gradually losing its sovereignty , and each of its nations together with her . 
 because only a collaborative effort of the europeans will be able to reduce the severity of debt of each , free markets and prepare for the future , investing in him . 
 after a long discussion of this proposal the socialists and jacques delors all now require , a european economic government . 
 but to submit it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , вошедшей граздан in life , is another madness and a new impasse . 
 to establish a republic in france , it was necessary to " create a " of republicans . 
 this can only be done through the creation of a more democratic europe on the political level , real people 's european sovereignty . 
 in fact , 2011 will be completed 11 % rise in the world sales of microprocessors ( bank cards , mobile phones with sim cards ) , above , according to the eurosmart , 6 thousand million units . 
 this year , 460 million in the world will be sold бесконтактных chip - cards against 320 million a year earlier ! 
 europe , the lagged for a long time from the asia - pacific region , are now moving forward in the field of бесконтактных payments . 
 france starts off with more modest positions : in circulation are 400,000 бесконтактных cards , visa . 
 this year , the carrefour issued a 2.5 million to бесконтактных pass mastercard . 
 " two large organizations in france promised in the future has systematically to distribute among their clients , bank cards , adapted for non - use , " said gerard небуи , director - general of the visa europe , france . 
 but this is only the first stage of development in the future means of payment , then there is a mobile phone . 
 " we look forward to the world 's sale from 80 to 120 million units in 2012 , " explains mark бертен , the head of the eurosmart . 
 yesterday , the crédit agricole announced experiment , from december through june of next year , in the massacre . 
 confirmed long предполагавшиеся links between the terrorist group al qaeda in the islamic maghreb ( aqmi ) , and the nigerian boko haram sect . 
 " the way in which use these two organizations , and reports to the secret services show that they were actively cooperating , " he explained , without going into the details . 
 among the debris , the remaining after the operation , french and нигерские investigators found a few phone sim - cards belonging to the terrorists . 
 analysis of the incidents calls pointed out several interlocutors , 58/89 in mali , niger and nigeria . 
 " this is a step forward , but there is no doubt that we need to wait for more reliable evidence , before the talk about operational cooperation between aqmi and boko haram . " 
 " for many years already , we know that the sect идейную and receives financial support from the outside and that it is becoming more and more intense , " says кунле амуво , a nigeria researcher . 
 the international community , headed by the washington now puts pressure on абуджу , they pay attention to the problems that creates the boko haram . 
 she aims mainly in on the of the church , bars and the law enforcement authorities . 
 in the past christmas day she took responsibility for the diluted earnings per share as a result of which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then again for one in abuja . 
 in august , the local branch of the united nations , will be their first international goal . 
 today , when the aqmi has spiked in mali and niger , and the somalis of al-shabaab operating in kenya , boko haram represents a new threat to the continent . 
 can weakened crisis america to take the lead of a complex world with the help of the simple , and the rather simplistic ideas ? 
 kane has a few days , mitt romney , the distance , rick perry and other множат loud , but deprived of the details of the statements on foreign policy , which are traditionally a strong republican party . 
 mitt romney , who has the best chance for the nomination from the " good old party , " has threatened to take on the chinese complaint to the wto and accuse them of " manipulating its currency is a sensitive topic for america , irritated migration as much as its industries in asia . 
 john huntsman , former obama ambassador to china and the only one candidate , the complex foreign policy , was unable to overcome position that indulging your emotions . 
 but the huntsman , who has been in the bottom of the ratings , has remained in неуслышанным . 
 romney also has vowed the military strikes on iran , if the sanctions will not be able to halt its nuclear programme . 
 " if obama will be re - elected , they will have a bomb . " 
 entrepreneur херман kane , the second in the ranking candidates demonstrated the daunting ignorance of the cases . 
 the texas governor rick perry , which supports israel and is committed to the military strikes on iran , says that he 's willing to use the american army against drug cartels in mexico . 
 all this is a far cry from the republican candidate john mccain 's 2008 , тяжеловеса foreign policy . 
 they remind us that obama was himself a lover and that he had to lower the tone in the respect of the fight against terror . 
 after iraq did not believe it is in the military intervention that увязают in the sand . 
 nord stream , the new gates for the entry of russian gas to europe . 
 he is calculated on the supply natural gas equivalent of the 30 million of households . 
 more than 500 guests , including four heads of state and governments took part in the last tuesday on the shores of the baltic sea , between orchestra and exquisite performance snacks , in the opening of the nord stream , a new gas pipeline , which directly connects russia and germany under the water . 
 on the new 27.5 thousands of millions of additional cubic meters of gas pipeline will come every year in western europe for the first 1 224 km long pipeline connecting the leningrad region with earth mecklenburg - western pomerania . 
 and an opportunity to build a third of the pipeline at the same direction has already been discussed . 
 these two countries will lose part of his authority : they will become more difficult to influence on russia , by threatening to shut down access to western european markets . 
 energy but at the cost of deprivation of europe , because the project has created a gap between eastern and western europe . 
 " this pipeline is part of cooperation with russia , this is a new artery that connects us organically , " said francois fillon , opening the gas pipeline , showing the extent to which the large natural gas contracts are important and politically and economically . 
 " one hundred of them was necessary to remove or destroy them as a precaution , " said jens muller , a spokeswoman for the company 's northern flow . 
 pipeline - this is a long metal serpent weight , equal to weight 242 эйфелевых towers , without breaks throughout its length , without вентилей and without service stations . 
 " we close the flow of gas in the event of an accident in less than one minute " , " jens mueller said . 
 but this seems unlikely that piping designers stitches , calculated on протечку only once in 100 000 years old . 
 сигароообразный аппарат introduced a 1 - meter diameter pipeline inside and pushed forward the flow of gas . 
 gas pipeline was designed to work in 50 years ago without the need for the slightest maintenance and repairs . 
 these five companies have created a joint venture , called the northern flow of , which has been instructed to build and operate gas pipeline . 
 then gazprom gave the company in the lease on the 20 years with the possibility of extension of the entire amount of gas transportation . 
 funding for natural gas pipeline was provided on 30 % of the shareholders , and the 70 % of bank credit . 
 out of the baltic sea natural gas pipeline in lubmin on a sandy beach , засаженный coniferous trees . 
 sensors measure the pressure , temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before they siphoned it in the german gas pipelines . 
 at full capacity , this will be 3 million in the hour , but in the 6 million by 2012 .
